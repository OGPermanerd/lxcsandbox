# Milestone v1.2: Auth & Polish

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-02
**Phases:** 10
**Total Plans:** 1

## Overview

v1.2 fixes authentication issues discovered during real-world usage. Claude Code and git credentials now copy automatically from host to container during provisioning.

## Phases

### Phase 10: Credential Setup

**Goal**: Claude Code and git work without manual authentication setup
**Depends on**: Phase 9 (v1.1 complete)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 10-01: Default Auth Copying — Remove --with-gh-creds flag, make credential copying default

**Success Criteria:**
1. New container has ~/.claude copied from host (Claude Code works without /login)
2. New container has ~/.ssh copied from host (SSH-based git operations work)
3. New container has ~/.config/gh copied from host (gh CLI works)
4. SSH known_hosts includes github.com and gitlab.com
5. Credentials exist for both root and dev users with correct ownership
6. `--with-gh-creds` flag is removed (credential copying is default)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Make credential copying default (no opt-in flag needed)
- Add GitHub/GitLab to known_hosts via ssh-keyscan (doesn't rely on host having them)
- Copy credentials to both root and dev users for consistency

**Issues Resolved:**
- Claude Code auth error requiring manual /login in new containers
- Git push/pull failing due to missing SSH keys and gh CLI auth

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
